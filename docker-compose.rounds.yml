# ============================================================================
# Rounds Docker Compose - Target Project Deployment
# ============================================================================
# USAGE:
#   1. Place this file in the ROOT of your target project directory (the application being monitored)
#   2. Copy .env.rounds.template to .env.rounds and configure
#   3. Run: docker-compose -f docker-compose.rounds.yml up -d
#
# The current directory (.) will be mounted as /workspace/target inside the container
# so Rounds can access your target project's codebase for diagnosis.
#
# See docs/QUICK_START_TARGET_PROJECT.md for detailed deployment instructions.
#
# Requirements:
#   - .env.rounds file with configuration (created from .env.rounds.template)
#   - rounds:dist image available (pull from Docker Hub or build locally)
#
# Volumes:
#   - Current directory (your project root) mounted read-only as /workspace/target
#   - .rounds/reports/ for diagnosis output
#   - rounds-data volume for signature database
